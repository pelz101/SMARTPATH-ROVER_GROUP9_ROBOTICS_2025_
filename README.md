SmartPath Rover README
Introduction
Welcome to the SmartPath Rover project! The SmartPath Rover is an advanced autonomous rover designed for research, exploration, and mapping tasks. This rover integrates cutting-edge technologies for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and environmental sensing, making it ideal for a wide range of outdoor applications, from scientific fieldwork to autonomous delivery.

Features
Autonomous Navigation: Equipped with an intelligent pathfinding algorithm for optimal route planning and obstacle avoidance.
Advanced Sensors: LIDAR, ultrasonic, and infrared sensors for environmental scanning and real-time data collection.
High-Resolution Camera: Capture images and videos for analysis, reconnaissance, or documentation.
GPS and Mapping: Accurate positioning and real-time map generation for navigation and localization.
Remote Control: Operable via a wireless remote control interface for manual navigation and interaction.
Data Logging: Collect environmental data for post-processing or real-time analysis.
Getting Started
Hardware Setup
Powering Up:
Connect the rover to a power source (battery or charging dock).
Turn on the rover using the power switch located on the rear panel.
Check Sensors and Cameras:
Ensure all sensors (LIDAR, ultrasonic, etc.) and the camera are properly connected.
If any components are disconnected, reconnect them according to the hardware manual.
Software Setup
Install Dependencies:

Clone the repository to your local machine using:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartpath-rover.git
Install required software libraries and dependencies. For example, using pip:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Calibration:

Run the calibration script to ensure proper alignment of sensors and cameras:
bash
Copy
python calibrate.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform a complete calibration.
Starting the Rover
To launch the rover's autonomous navigation system:

bash
Copy
python start_rover.py
The rover will begin its pathfinding operations using the pre-programmed algorithms and available sensor data.

Remote Control
For manual control, you can use the SmartPath Rover mobile app or a compatible controller (e.g., joystick, gamepad). Ensure Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity is active.

Connect to Rover:
Open the app or use the controller interface.
Connect to the rover by selecting the device name (e.g., "SmartPath Rover").
Manual Control:
Use the app or controller to navigate the rover in real-time.
Adjust speed, direction, and camera angle as needed.
Troubleshooting
Rover is not powering on:

Check the power supply and ensure the battery is charged.
Verify the power switch is in the "on" position.
Sensor malfunctions:

Run the sensor diagnostic tool to check for any misconfigurations or failures.
Recalibrate the sensors if necessary.
Connectivity issues:

Ensure Wi-Fi/Bluetooth is functioning correctly.
Check for interference or weak signals in the area.
Safety Information
Always operate the rover in safe environments and avoid obstacles that could cause damage.
Ensure that the rover is in a stable position before initiating movement.
Be aware of the rover's surroundings when using remote control to avoid accidents.
